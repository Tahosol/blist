# About Blist:

A large blocklist with duplicate entries reduced, mainly aimed at blocking trackers, ads, malware, and malicious websites. It can and will have false positives. If any false positives occur, you can report them here, and I may try to fix it and report it to the upstream. Keep in mind that this essentially means I may or may not fix it, depending on my mood when you file a report.
