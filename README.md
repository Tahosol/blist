# About Blist:

This made by me to reduce duplication domain when I use multiple blocklists for adguard home. If you use this blocklist, do not use any other list in the credit section. This blocklist should be good for any pihole/adguard home setup. If you want something more like block NSFW or Gambling or something else you can find and add them your self.

## If you want to add a blocklist into this make a new issue

# Credit:
It is in the credit.txt file

# Usage
